# Inverting a Binary Tree

### Recursion
Recursively swap the left and right children of the current node until reaching the leaves of the tree.

### Python
In Python, this is implemented in a simple recursive function that checks for the base case (null node), then calls itself for the left and right children, and swaps them.

### Java
In Java, the approach is the same as Python, but with a syntax appropriate for Java. An auxiliary `TreeNode` variable is used to hold one of the branches during the swap.

## Follow-up (Iterative Approach)
For the iterative approach, a stack or queue can be used to process nodes breadth-first or depth-first, respectively, while swapping the children of each node.
