1) As n grows larger, n^3 term grows faster than any constant multiple of n^2
hence it is asymptotically greater

2) n^2log(n) grows faster due to the presence of n^2, hence it asymptotically greater

3) 2^n grows faster as it has exponential growth comapred to the polynomial groweth of nlog(n)

4) 2^2n is asymptotically greater as it grows exponentially faster than 2^n

Problem 2:



Best Case - O(1) (N is even number greater than 2)
Worst Case - O(sqrt(n)) (when n is prime number requiring the loop to iterate )
Average Case O(sqrt(n)) (when n is prime number requiring the loop to iterate )
