   - First, we sort the array. Sorting helps in easily skipping duplicates and efficiently using the two-pointer technique.

   - For each element in the array, set one pointer just after the current element (left) and another at the end of the array (right).
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at these three positions. If the sum is zero, add it to the result list.
   - Move the left pointer right to skip duplicates if the sum is less than zero, or move the right pointer left if the sum is greater than zero.

   - After processing a triplet, skip all duplicates of the element currently being considered to avoid adding duplicate triplets to the result.

- This method is efficient as it reduces the problem to a two-sum problem, which can be solved in linear time using two pointers.


- The initial sorting takes (O(n \log n) time, which is necessary for the two-pointer approach to work effectively.


This approach effectively finds all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero, utilizing the sorted property of the array to manage and check pairs efficiently.
