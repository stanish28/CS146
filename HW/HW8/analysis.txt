   - Use an array or a dictionary to count how frequently each character appears in the string.

   - Add all even counts fully to the palindrome length, as pairs of characters can symmetrically flank the center.
   - For characters with odd counts, add the largest even number smaller than each count (count - 1) to the palindrome length. This utilizes as many characters as possible for symmetrical pairing.
   - If there are any characters with an odd count, add one more to the length for a central character, which does not need a pair.


All characters that appear an even number of times can be fully used in the palindrome.
From each odd count, one character can potentially be placed in the center of the palindrome, enhancing the length by 1 if at least one odd count exists.
The method operates in linear time complexity, \(O(n)\), making it efficient for input sizes up to the problem's constraints.

The solution is straightforward and runs in linear time, efficiently handling strings up to the maximum length constraint.

This approach efficiently determines the maximum length of a palindrome that can be constructed, ensuring optimal use of each character's frequency.
